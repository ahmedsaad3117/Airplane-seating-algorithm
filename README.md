# Airplane-seating-algorithm

Write	a	program	that	helps	seat	audiences	in	a	flight	based	on	the	
following	input	and	rules.
Rules	for	sea+ng	
• Always	seat	passengers	star:ng	from	the	front	row	to	back,	
star:ng	from	the	le=	to	the	right	
• Fill	aisle	seats	first	followed	by	window	seats	followed	by	center	
seats	(any	order	in	center	seats)	
Input	to	the	program	will	be		
• a	2D	array	that	represents	the	rows	and	columns	[	[3,4],	[4,5],	
[2,3],	[3,4]	]	
• Number	of	passengers	wai:ng	in	queue.
